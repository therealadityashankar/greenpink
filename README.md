A programming language, thats fun to write, is built from scratch to get compiled and interpreted, and is directly restrictive in nature,

# short idea summary

## Roadmap

#### compilable, 

#### interpretable, 

#### restictive (filesystem read/file system write/other access is gained explicitly)

#### single page documented

#### single page tested

#### understandable at a glance

#### type inference for everything including return types, so functions do not need to declare return types, I really really dont want to do that !

#### no var/const/let or anything

#### maybe -

#### in parameter special keywords, thatis

instead of
```
open("abc.xyz", "wb")
```

we get
```
open("abc.xyz", wb)
```

#### directly grasped number types (Int32, or Float64, or otherwise), otherwise
